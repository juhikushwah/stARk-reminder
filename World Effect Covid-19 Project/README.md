Created a world effect on Spark AR using 3D objects from AR Library and SketchFab,textures and animation. 

This is a world space effect built for Facebook and Instagram platform in which people can walk around and see the virus objects floating in real world. People will walk around and there is a sanitizer object somewhere in between. When the user taps it, a message pops up.
